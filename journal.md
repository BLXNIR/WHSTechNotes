Its important to keep your information safe so that it doesnt get leaked online. You can enable 2FA so that it is more secure.

You can not share private information when doing collaborative activites and share stuff that is less personal and private.

I think techonology could make food more affordable and accessable by making records of what if bought in stores and suplying more to those items. The negative side affect of this is that it could be wrong and could supply wrong things or be a wrong location.

AI could impact everyones life by making it easier but could also cause issues. One way it could cause a good impact is like helping people with their work. A bad impact it could have would be making people unemployed. The thing that excites me about AI, is that it could be more human, so I could cheat on my assignments. Ai could be used in my field of interest (gaming) it could make a game one day just by me telling it what to do. The ethical consideration would be to have more jobs that need people before having technology steal jobs from people.

This shift from prioritizing ai over tech workers woukd be good and bad because of the erros they make but they can both be good. I believe ai tools will definitely enhance workers. I will learn how to do something ai isnt taking over.

Technology can help educators and service provider with new slang by being able to show them the definition. The benefits is that itll help the youth understand and the downfall is that it woudlnt sound good if used incorrectly. I think schools should integrate slang because i believe it would make people enjoy it more. Misunderstanding could lead to bad stuff happening which is why it proabably snt used.

I feel emotionally, physically, and mantally fine. The most stressful part of school is the classwork. To take care of myself during stressful times is to not do whatver is making me stressed and completely dropping it. One goal for the schol year is to pass, and i will accomplish this by doing the bare minimum work to pass. A person I trust is Jasmine because she's trustworthy.

I think the humans because they can last longer. I think its very responsible because it will show how capable people are. I also believe Mrbeast should make a video on this topic. Trends spread online have great topics to debate about and get the community involved.

This trend isnt ethical. Using tech responsibly is important cause it could blow up killing everybody. A real world consequence could lead yu in jail because yu could accidently hurt someone seriously.
