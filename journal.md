AI could impact everyones life by making it easier but could also cause issues. One way it could cause a good impact is like helping people with their work. A bad impact it could have would be making people unemployed. The thing that excites me about AI, is that it could be more human, so I could cheat on my assignments.

The ethical consideration would be to have more jobs that need people before having technology steal jobs from people.
