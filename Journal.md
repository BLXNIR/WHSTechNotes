I enjoy playing Osu!
Osu! is a rythym game where you click circles. i foind this game very fun and challenging. I say this because the diffulty make you push pass your limits and it is very fun. I wanna be able to do hard maps in the game so i can be looked up to for new players that wanna get good at the game.
